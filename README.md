# About

This repository covers implementation of various machine learning techniques. 

Implementation is mostly done by tensorflow and its dependencies.

The repository covers udacity's course on Introduction to Tensorflow for deep learning and Tensorflow's playlist on youtube. 



# NLP folder

This folder implements basic natural language processing using tensorflow.
 
#### recognize_sentiment_sarcasm.ipynb

Trained a model to predict if a news headline is sarcastic or not.

#### Standardization in sklearn.ipynb

Used StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler to standardize values in sklearn.

#### create_poetry.ipynb

Given an irish poem, created a model using rnn to generate a new poem.



# Image_recognition folder

This folder implements image classification using tensorflow.

#### Basic_computer_vision.ipynb

Implements clothing image classification without image augmentation.

#### code_to_graph.ipynb
